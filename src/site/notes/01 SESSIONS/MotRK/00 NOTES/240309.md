##### GAME NOTES 

Following a **[Tip from 'Red Bag'](https://imgur.com/cJHBnnH)**, the party traveled to **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/01 CAMPAIGN/TUGBY\|Tugby]]**. There, the party met **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Krayna\|Krayna]]**, **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Allin\|Allin]]** & **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Reese\|Reese]]** in **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/01 CAMPAIGN/The Last Drop Inn\|The Last Drop]]** as they sat down for ale and mutton stew.  Burtle promptly burgled the establishment while the party was trying to gather info on the **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/07 Appendix B - Magic Items/Armoire of Invulnerability\|Armor of Invulnerability]]** from the patrons.   

**[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Ilfen Dindrer\|Ilfen]]**, the village smith, burst in asking for help retrieving his son, **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Bryce Dindrer\|Bryce]]** who has been missing 2 days.  He promises what gold he has, as well as blacksmithing services.  The party agrees, and with the help of **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Wrin\|Wrin]]** make their way to **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/01 CAMPAIGN/OLD CAVE\|Old Cave]]**.

Upon entering the cave, the party is beset by Spider Rats on the ceiling and a pack of Giant Rats on the ground.  Burtle got webbed a few times.  After defeating them, the party found a storage room with a **[Journal](https://imgur.com/hT2NuPI)** containing entries about potion development and "the Old Voice."  The party also finds a secret door that leads to a room with a slimy statue and some coin + a citrine.

With _Detect Magic_ still operational, the party found an area of the cavern that was alarmed.  Thrya _Misty Stepped_ past it, but the rest of the party bulled through anyway raising the alarm.  A large fight ensued.  

The party headed away from the fungus room and discovered a room filled with cages of mutated rats.  **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/05 Appendix A - Creatures/Mr. Nibbles\|Mr. Nibbles]]** began speaking in everybody's head and offering to help in exchange for magical knowledge.  From it, you learn that the boy, **[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/11 NPCs/Bryce Dindrer\|Bryce]]** is being tortured next door and that "the Master" always enters the Demon Door with a purple flower.

You free Bryce and escort him to the cave mouth, then return to examine the door.  Purple stains on the demon's mouth lend credence to **[Mr. Nibbles'](https://imgur.com/1tNiAnW)** purple flower story, so you head back to the purple-glowing fungus room to see if they can be found there.  Impatient with the strategy discussion, Burtle runs into the fungus room and activates several Violet Fungi.  He escapes unharmed, and then goes back in sneaking past them.

Beyond the fungal chamber is a pool of water that contains another man-fish statue.  It holds a bowl of dark liquid with purple lotuses floating on it.  Burtle retrieves the flowers, but not before heading a creepy voice in his mind that entices him to add his blood to the bowl and "take the power."

At the Demon Door, the party indeed finds that the flowers open the door and a small bedroom lies beyond.  A bedside table contains letters to various governments and nobles demanding immediate surrender to "the Rat King" in order to save the surface world from "the Old Voice."  It also contains a **[2nd Journal](https://imgur.com/HjU9B2g)**, again with disturbed entries regarding the Old Voice.

When Burtle attempts to investigate the chest, it attacks him .  The mimic manages to get a couple of good bites in before it is killed.
