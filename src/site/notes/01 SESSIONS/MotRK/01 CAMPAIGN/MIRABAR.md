## MIRABAR

Barnibus & Zorzire met in the foothills of the Spine of the World, both walking to Mirabar.  As those hills are known for opportunism and banditry, they agreed to travel together.  Neither spoke much, but over the days they found that they had much in common despite traveling for different reasons.  

For Barnibus, it was as simple as no longer having a tribe and being sick of the cold.  Barnibus had long dreamt of the warmth and beaches of a land called Chult described by a scraggly human wanderer long before.  With no home, Barnibus has decided that he will find Chult and is headed south towards where he expects it to be.

Zorzire is headed to Mirabar on more urgent business.  His sanctuary is under threat from the fire giants, and he has been selected to head into the more-populated south in search of an answer or aid.

Mirabar proved to neither be Chult, nor any help with the giants, but it was good at draining your meager purses.  So, the two agree to sign on as security for a barge convoy headed to Luskan.  On the uneventful trip, Zorzire discovered that Barnibus' people were wiped out by the Frost Giants and both bonded over the chaos that ensued from the breaking of the Ordning.

Overhearing this conversation about giants, Thyra, one of the passengers, introduced herself and interjected that she too is headed to Mirabar for giant-related business.  Her stone giant mentor, Liknvi, has fallen ill along with her kinfolk back in the Moonshaes's.  Thyra is scouring the continent for knowledge or a cure to save them and wonders what Barnibus & Zorzire know about the maladies of giant kind.

The three of you conclude that the Gods & fate must have brought you together, and you agree to seek your warmth and answers together so long as it makes sense.  You all find each other's company unexpectedly pleasant and you look forward to the end of the barge trip and the unknown adventures that follow.

As the convoy pulled into Luskan, you notice a small, smiling halfling waving you over from the bank.  When you approach, he introduces himself as Burtle and asks if you might be willing to go on a small adventure for a fair share of the proceeds...

The offer the Burtle brings is simple; join forces to follow a tip, travel through the Crags and retrieve a suit of magical armor worth a lot of money.  The costs and the proceeds of any treasure received is to be split four ways.

Again seeing the hands of the Fates, you all agree and after shaking on it in the customary Luskan manner, Burtle hands over a small scrap of parchment.  When everyone has examined it, he hurriedly tucks it back into his vest and adds:

"I think we should leave right away and pick up supplies on the road" and begins making for the road east out of the North Gate...
