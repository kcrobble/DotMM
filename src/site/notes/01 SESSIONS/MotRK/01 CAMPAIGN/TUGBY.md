## TUGBY

Tugby is a small town.  From the top of the grassy rise you stand upon, it appears neither prosperous nor poor.  The green hills that surround the town are dotted with sheep and the occasional, faster herding dog. 

[[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/01 CAMPAIGN/TUGBY\|The Last Drop Inn]] is the largest structure in Tugby and also the center of what little activity you can see from the hills above the town.

Your party draws some curious looks as you enter the small village and approach [[01 SESSIONS/MotRK/01 CAMPAIGN/TUGBY\|The Last Drop Inn]].  A pair of stiff canvas curtains, discolored by the passage of patrons, serve as a door.
