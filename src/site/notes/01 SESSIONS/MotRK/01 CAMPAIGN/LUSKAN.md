## LUSKAN

You hurry through the narrow streets of Luskan doubling back and checking behind you constantly.  You memorize the face of every passerby, always scanning for any hint of disguise.  Your disgust is a bitter, metallic taste in your throat.  Just last evening, you owned these streets.

If anyone is to blame, it's the Baker.  Sure you owed him, but you never would have gone to Grygnorl if the Baker had just let you borrow a bit more.  Chanrin was a sure bet.  A.sure.bet.  You've never been more certain of it.  

All there is to do now is figure out who screwed you and pay them in kind.  

The Baker?  Maybe.  It's hard to see how...or why 

Gringorol?  Yeah, probably.  She's the one who gave you the money.  It would have been easy for her to fix the race to put you over the anvil.  She knew how deep you were in to the Baker.  She was ready with the offer to waive the debt as soon as the race was over.  Probably Gringorol.

If nothing else, you owe Gringorol for making you think the tip in the Baker's strongbox was worth stealing in the first place.  You knew you couldn't risk staying in Luskan after stealing from the Baker, so it was an easy choice to cross Gringorol at the same time and cash in on whatever it was that that toad-bitch set you up for.

It cost you a good chunk of your running money to get the Beshaba-damned thing decoded and it stinks more of bullshit & dreams than it does of gold.  And just like that, home is now a poison that will kill you if you stay.

Dogshit or no, the tip is the only card you have left to play but it does not look like a one-halfling job.  There's not a cutpurse in Luskan stupid enough to throw in with you now, so you make for the Mirabar district, hoping that the solution to your dilemma might float down the Mirar and into your life.  

You let out a low whistle when the 5th barge hove into view, there is a  giant blue lummox and a dragon man foreigner in easy conversation with some Moonshae-looking woman.  If anyone can help you get that armor on short notice, then those 3 can.  You meet them on the dock with a proposition...
