## trail to Old Cave

> The morning sun warms your backs as you follow the shepherd's boy out of the hamlet and along the edge of some fields.  Without a word, he turns and begins to lead you up a narrow track into the wild and rocky hills above the town.  At times you see no sign of the faint trail at all, but Wrin unerringly picks up the trail after every rockfall and thicket of sedge.
> 
> As the sun climbs above the trees and you wipe the sweat from your neck with a curse.  The heat, the buzzing of insects, the narrow,  dusty track and a throbbing head all conspire to make this morning less pleasant by the minute.    
> 
> You begin to wonder if leaving the North for warmer climes was such a good idea after all.  Worse, you begin to wonder if free ale is not as great as you had always believed it to be.  Your thoughts turn to the reward.  Is it even worth it?  100GP may be a lot for a blacksmith, but its not that much when you split it four ways...
> 
> With a guilty start, you think of the blacksmith's face as he begged you to find his son.  You didn't have the heart to tell him that his son, -Bruce was it?, is probably already dead.  If the boy went into a cave and has not been seen for 3 days then he probably won't be seen again.  Nothing good ever came from a cave...
> 
> The slowing of the boy interrupts your disagreeable thoughts as he reaches a small copse of birch trees that bound a tiny, tumbling stream.  Pointing at a patch of sand he says;
> 
> 	That's where I found Bryce's blanket; folded neat as a pin.
> 
> Stepping over the stream into the bright sunlight, Wrin points up the hillside: 
> 
> 	-and that's the Old Cave.  Allin & Reese says theys been in it and saw a ghost, but my Da says not to believe a word from out of those two villains.
>   
> Wrin steals a look at you to see if a reprimand was coming, and seeing none, continues:
> 
> 	Da says the cave's empty but dangerous nohow, and says I am not to go innit.  He don't need to tell me twice.  I don't like dark places and I aint never going in there.   
> 
> The few hundred meters are loose talus from rockfalls higher up.  Amongst the loose stones an outcrop of rock juts like the bow of a sinking ship. The ink-dark gash of an irregular cave mouth mars the illusion.
> 
> You press the promised silvers into Wrin's hand and thank him, telling him that if you do not return before nightfall he is to head back to his homestead and return the following morning for you.  
> 
> Unable the take his eyes off the small pile of coins in his hand, Wrin nods.  
> 
> 	I sure hope you find him.  Bryce aint my friend but I hate to think of him stuck in that dark cave by hisself.
> 
> Putting his back to a tree, the boy sits in the cool shade of the trees to wait.
> 
> After a quick splash and drink in the cold stream, you turn and begin the hot climb up the dusty and unstable scree towards the yawning darkness of the Old Cave.
