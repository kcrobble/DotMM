[[LUSKAN\|LUSKAN]]

Barnibus is from a village in the Icerim Mountains. The entire village was destroyed by frost giants. He's the only survivor and sick of the cold desolate north. He was heading south to a land he's heard of call Chult. He dreams of warm waters and laying on a beach. Looks like I met Michaels character in Luskan as I head south.

i was thinking that i headed towards (?) to save my sanctuary which is under threat from fire giants. they are warring with the frost giants and believe my sanctuary holds an item that has given the frost giants the upper hand. i'm thinking the sanctuary is within a floating glacier that the fire giants have yet to find.

burtle is an orphan, or orphaned himself if you believe the tales, and went underground to survive in the criminal underworld doing small deeds and contracts, he is ready for the big time and looking for a way to get out and on up, perhaps these wary adventures will serve his needs for a spell, though his criminal underpinnings sometimes call him back, and old contracts show up when least expected

# Barnibus, Thyra & Zorzire
Barnibus & Zorzire met in the foothills of the Spine of the World, both walking to Mirabar.  As those hills are know for opportunism and banditry, they agreed to travel together.  Though neither spoke much, over the days they found that they had much in common though they traveled for different reasons.  

For Barnibus, it was as simple as no longer having a tribe and being sick of the cold.  Barnibus had long dreamt of the warmth and beaches of a land called Chult described by a scraggly human wanderer long before.  With no home, Barnibus has decided that he will find Chult and is headed south towards where he expects it to be.

Zorzire is headed to Mirabar on more urgent business.  His sanctuary is under threat from the fire giants, and he has been selected to head into the more-populated south in search of an answer.

Mirabar proved to neither be Chult, nor any help with the giants so the two agree to sign on as security for a barge convoy headed to Luskan.  On the uneventful trip, Zorzire discovered that Barnibus' people were wiped out by the Frost Giants and they both bonded over the chaos that ensued from the breaking of the Ordning.

Overhearing this conversation about giants, Thyra, one of the passengers, introduced herself and interjected that she too is headed to Mirabar for giant-related business.  Her stone giant mentor, Liknvi, has fallen ill along with her kinfolk back in the Moonshaes's.  Thyra is scouring the continent for knowledge or a cure to save them.

The three of you conclude that the Gods & fate must have brought you together, and you agree to seek your warmth and answers together so long as it makes sense.

As the convoy pulled into Luskan, you notice a small, smiling halfling waving you over from the bank...

# Burtle
You hurry through the narrow streets of Luskan doubling back and checking behind you constantly.  You memorize the face of every passerby, always scanning for any hint of disguise.  Your disgust is a bitter, metallic taste in your throat.  Just last evening, you owned these streets.

If anyone is to blame, it's the Baker.  Sure you owed him, but you never would have gone to Grygnorl if the Baker had just let you borrow a bit more.  Chanrin was a sure bet.  A.sure.bet.  You've never been more certain of it.  

All there is to do now is figure out who screwed you and pay them in kind.  

The Baker?  Maybe.  It's hard to see how...or why 

Gringorol?  Yeah, probably.  She's the one who gave you the money.  It would have been easy for her to fix the race to put you over the anvil.  She knew how deep you were in to the Baker.  She was ready with the offer to waive the debt as soon as the race was over.  Probably Gringorol.

If nothing else, you owe Gringorol for making you think the tip in the Baker's strongbox was worth stealing in the first place.  You knew you couldn't risk staying in Luskan after stealing from the Baker, so it was an easy choice to cross Gringorol at the same time and cash in on whatever it was that that toad-bitch set you up for.

It cost you a good chunk of your running money to get the Beshaba-damned thing decoded and it stinks more of bullshit & dreams than it does of gold.  And just like that, home is now a poison that will kill you if you stay.

Dogshit or no, the tip is the only card you have left to play but it does not look like a one-halfling job.  There's not a cutpurse in Luskan stupid enough to throw in with you now, so you make for the Mirabar district, hoping that the solution to your dilemma might float down the Mirar and into your life.  

You let out a low whistle when the 5th barge hove into view, there is a  giant blue lummox and a dragon man foreigner in easy conversation with some Moonshae-looking woman.  If anyone can help you get that armor on short notice, then those 3 can.  You meet them on the dock with a proposition...
