##### GAME NOTES 

The party began in the Rat King's bedroom where Thyra finds a trapdoor beneath the carcass of the Mimic.  Burtle opens it and descends to the bottom of a short stair where he spies a few more rat minions.  He throws his torch into the room and leaves.

Barnibus decides to lead the charge and enters a darkened laboratory full of rat monstrosities.  He attacks the bear rat and immediately after is hit in the shin by a bomb rat.  His amusement does not last long as a vial sails out of the darkness and bursts, spreading flaming liquid down his leg.  Then, a tiny canary/rat hybrid scrabbled up to let out a tremendous squawk that blasts him over but not before exploding the two bomb rats' acid guts all over him leaving him prone & on fire.  That is when the dragon rat clumsily flapped over and bathed him in poison gas, knocking him unconscious.

The party piles into the room, and Thyra heals Barnibus before he can die.  A long fight marked by poor rolls ensues.  Spider rats annoyingly impede actions and movements.  The dragon rat & squeaker rat nip and bite the PCs, the bear rat bites & slobbers while the Rat King throws chemical grenades from the darkness.

Zorzire casts  _Faerie Fire_ into the back of the lab, illuminating their hidden foe for the first time; it is a crazed looking elf in a lab coat.  The tides start to turn as damage accumulates on the bear rat and the Rat King who attempts to surrender.  No quarter is given & after many rounds, the Rat King dies & Barnibus finally puts his burning leg out.  The fight is finished.  The party finds precursor chemicals, some chemical grenades, several healing potions & a magic staff in the lab.

Heading back up to the bedroom, the Zorzire's _Detect Magic_ spell shows that the armoire has a blindingly bright *abjuration* dweomer.  Burtle opens it to find a sky-blue silk vest with silver clouds and a *transmutation* aura.  A quick conference leads to the decision to explore the underground river.

The party finds the river to be wide, but shallow (and slimy).  While crossing, Burtle falls and Thyra & Zorzire find a magic gold ring (*abjuration*).  On the far shore, the skeletal remains of an elf clutches a warning scrawled in blood:

> [!quote|author] E.
> darkmantles ahead
> -too many
> take the Herald to Tågehjem

There is also a magic lantern (*divination*) made of fine, grey steel next to the remains.

Barnibus decides to advance into the passageway and is almost immediately attacked by a darkmantle.  After ripping it off his head, the area is plunged into magical darkness.  The cave-squid attacks his face again and he retreats back to the light.

Zorzire wild shapes into a spider, and heads into the darkness to also have his head engulfed by a darkmantle.  He too retreats.
