## Steady_Aim

As a [Bonus Action](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#bonus%20action_xphb), you give yourself [Advantage](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#advantage_xphb) on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your [Speed](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#speed_xphb) is 0 until the end of the current turn.
