## Two-Weapon_Fighting

When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action and attack with a [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light) melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light) melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.<br><br>If either weapon has the [thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.
