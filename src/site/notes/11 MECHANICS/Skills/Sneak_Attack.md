## Sneak_Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.<br><br>You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the [[11 MECHANICS/Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.<br><br>The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.
