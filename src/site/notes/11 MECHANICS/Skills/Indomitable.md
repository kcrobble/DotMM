## Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level:
- You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.  
- You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.
