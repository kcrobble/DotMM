- **_D20 Tests Affected._** When you make a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.

- **_Speed Reduced._** Your [Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed) is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.

- **_Removing Exhaustion Levels._** Finishing a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.
