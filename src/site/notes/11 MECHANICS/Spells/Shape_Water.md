### Shape Water

**Level:** `=this.Level` ||  **Casting Time:** `=this.CastingTime` || **Range/Area:** 30 ft, 5 ft Cube || **Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous || **Attack/Save:** None || **Damage/Effect:** Control

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:<br><br>- You instantaneously **move or otherwise change the flow** of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.<br><br>- You cause the water to **form into simple shapes and animate** at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.<br><br>- You change the water’s **color or opacity**. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.<br><br>- You **freeze the water**, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.<br><br>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
