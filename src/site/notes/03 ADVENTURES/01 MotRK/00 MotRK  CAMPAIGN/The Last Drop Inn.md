## The Last Drop Inn

> The Inn's common room is more busy than you had expected.  The interior is dim, lit by a few windows and lanterns.  The atmosphere is subdued, and somber turn towards the door and stick.  
> 
> Eyes widen, especially when Barnibus ducks beneath the lintel and again when Zorzire pushes through the canvas.  You are pretty sure that Tugby does not get a lot of outsiders, especially extremely tall, blue goliaths nor dragon men.

> Behind the bar is a thin woman with short grey hair and a large burn scar on one forearm.  She raises her eyebrows in greeting and her voice cuts across the silent room:

> 	 "Welcome, strangers.  What'll you have?"
