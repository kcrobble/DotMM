#### THE TIME DUMP THEORY
1)  [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Hobo Dr.\|the Hobo Dr.]] is not the killer, [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Hobo Dr.\|the Hobo Dr.]] collects victims for the [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Torso Killer\|the Torso Killer]]
2) The [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Torso Killer\|the Torso Killer]] murders his/her victims in the future but dumps the bodies in the past.  Characters in the present may be killed in the future but show up as victims in the past
	- [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/One-Armed Willy\|One-Armed Willy]] is No. [[Torso Killings/_Victims/12\|12]] _(basis of the theory)_
	- **Dr. Jeff** could be **Nos. 09, 05** based on his nightmares
	- **Frank Dolezau** could be **Nos. 01, 05, 09**
		- **No. 01** being found with **No. 02** fits well 
			- _Emasculation as feminine revenge_? 
	- **Mondo** could be **No. 04**
	- **Dr. Bob** could be **Nos. 01, 05, 09**
	- **No. 13** could be a retro-dump of a preserved **No. 07**
