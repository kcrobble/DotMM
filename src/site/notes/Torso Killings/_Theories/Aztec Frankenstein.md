2) The [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Torso Killer\|the Torso Killer]] collects body parts from his victims to build/rebuild CoyolxƒÅuhqui Stone (why?)
3) The [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Torso Killer\|the Torso Killer]] dumps bodies along rail lines, he may do the killings in the rail cars, or just use them for transport
4) A Kill site or Lair is likely to be found under railroad bridges on the Cuyahoga

	2) running trains
5) Early amputations likely done by [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Hobo Dr.\|the Hobo Dr.]]. (professional), whereas later ones by [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Torso Killer\|the Torso Killer]] (frenzied).  Between No. 8 & No. 9 [[Torso Killings/_NPCs/the Hobo Dr.\|the Hobo Dr.]] may have gotten cold feet, been imprisoned, injured/killed or become a victim himself (No. 8.5).
