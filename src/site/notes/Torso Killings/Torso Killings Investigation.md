#### MAP OF VICTIMS
https://caltopo.com/m/P1T1U57

#### REVELATIONS
- Rail lines are key; dump sites & likely ritual killing site _(see [[Torso Killings/Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY\|Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY]])_
- One-armed Willy is **victim No. B** - He will indeed be "killed in 1929" **time-travel is at work**
- Dr. Hobo is likely **victim No. 5** _(see [[Torso Killings/Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY\|Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY]])_

#### QUESTIONS
- Does the Hobo Dr. drive himself or have a driver/assistant?
- ~~Were victims 9 & 10 slain by a different killer, or the same killer before he got good?~~ _(Hobo Dr killed all but 9 or 10, see [[Torso Killings/Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY\|Torso Killings Investigation#AZTEC HOBO THEORY]])_
- How does time-travel play into this? _(see [[Torso Killings/Torso Killings Investigation#REVELATIONS\|Torso Killings Investigation#REVELATIONS]])_
- Given time-travel, how can we construct a chronology?
- How do the tattoos relate to victim selection?
- How do the tattoos relate to the dismemberment / Coyolxāuhqui rebuild?


#### ACTION
- Talk to Frank Dolezau
- Stake Out One-armed Willy
- Visit bridge sites, particularly in Big Creek

#### AZTEC HOBO THEORY
1) The Hobo Dr. is not the killer, the Hobo Dr. collects victims for the Aztec Hobo
2) The Aztec Hobo collects body parts from his victims to build/rebuild Coyolxāuhqui Stone (why?)
3) The Aztec Hobo dumps bodies along rail lines, he may do the killings in the rail cars, or
4) A Kill site or Lair is likely to be found under railroad bridges on the Cuyahoga
	1) running water
	2) running trains
5) Early amputations likely done by Hobo Dr. (professional), whereas later ones by Aztec Hobo (frenzied).  Between No. 8 & No. 9 Hobo Dr. may ~~have gotten cold feet, been imprisoned, injured/killed or~~ become a victim himself (No. 8.5).  Dr. Hobo is **victim No. 5**

#### THEORY BITS
- killer is time-jumping, newspaper dates, one-armed willy
- water / train angle - all killings under a mile from a train line
- killer assembling something from parts / aztec tattoo dismembered goddess
